	- Complex Prog = More bugs
	- OOP allows functions to be placed into english terms
	- Abstraction: Hide details and talk about functions at a "higher" (more simple) level.
	- Useful skill: Know when you're working at low level abstraction.
	- Higher order functions: functions that operate on other functions.
	- Abstract over actions and not just value
		○ Functions that return functions
		○ Functions that change other functions
		○ Functions that provide new control flow.
	- Using unicode as an example of abstraction…
		○ Unicode contains ranges of foreign language scripts (cyrillic, arabic, etc)
		○ Filter arrays can be used to remove unicode characters no longer in use (see book example).
	- Pure functions never modify passed values but return new ones.
	- Map method "maps" one array to a new form. Like a copy constructor that creates a modified copy?
	- Reduce()  values argument and returns a single value summary.
		○ Is this particularly useful for summing word count or other array lengths?
	- Han unification treats all JP, CN, KOR Han characters as the same set. (makes some people angry
	- UTF-16 is a bad idea in hindsight. If your language uses more than two-unit characters (like vague CN characters)
		○ JS operations length of strings only deals with code units. (emojis can cause errors to be thrown when attempting to access chars within index.
charCodeAt and codePointAt returns the full unicode character.
