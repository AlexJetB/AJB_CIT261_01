	- Objects allow us to group values (bools, ints, strings) into more complex
  structures.
Data Sets:
	- Arrays are a helpful data structure that allow access of value by a known
  index (first, second, third value, etc)
	- First index of an array is 0 (duh)
Properties:
	- All values contain properties which can be accessed by keywords, such as
  length.
	- Null and undefined have no properties.
	- Length for an array tells how many elements it has.
	- Can be used for looping termination condition.
Methods:
	- All values also contain methods…
	- Basically, default functions with JavaScript that mutate the value in some
  way.
	- Ex. toUpperCase() makes all characters in a string upper case.
	- Ex. Push(value) places a value at the end of an array. Pop() removes item
  at end.
Objects:
	- One way to create an object is to use braces as an expression.
	- Properties basically look like a key value pair of a map.
	- Object.keys returns properties of an object.
Mutability:
	- Int, bool and string values are "immutable", meaning it "is impossible to
  change values of those types". You can combine or create new values from them,
  but not change existing text.
	- Objects can have their proprerties changed, meaning they are mutable.
	- No "deep" comparison operator built into JavaScript. No true overloading of
  operators either.
Computing Correlation:
	- Includes "checks whether a given value exists in the array".
	- tableFor "figures out which box in the table each journal entry falls into".
	- Correla
Array Loops:
	- Common for loop that goes through the entire length and terminates by length
  is very common.
		○ In many cases can be written as 'for (let entry of journal)' where entry
    serves as the individual item being looked at.
Further Arrayology:
	- Shift and unshift are used to move items at the start of an array rather
  than the end.
	- IndexOf() finds first occurrence of desired value.
	- lastIndexOf() finds last occurrence of desired value.
Strings and Their Properties:
	- You cannot add a new property to strings, ints or bools.
	- Strings have many methods in JS to be manipulatd with, such as trim(),
  join(), split(), etc.
Rest Parameters:
	- '…' indicates all previous values are ignored. It spreads out an array when
  called.
The Math Object:
	- Math is a default JS object often used to perform calculations. It contains
  methods such as max() and min(), as well as properties such as pi
Destructuring:
	- You can use square brackets to look inside of a binded value an its contents.
	- If attempted with a null or undefined, you get an error.
JSON:
	- Data structure typically used to communicate information.
	- Parse() and stringify() functions available in JS.
