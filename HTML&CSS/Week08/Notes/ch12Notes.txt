		○ Supported on:
			§ Chrome 4+
			§ Firefox 2+
			§ Opera 9.6+
			§ Safari 3.1+
			§ iOS 3.2+
			§ IE 9.0+
			§ Android 3.0+
		○ First developed by Apple.
	- Canvas element created using canvas tag and giving ID and Class.
	- Context is place in canvas were the drawing is rendered.
	- Only wide support for 2 dimensions.
	- Stroke is border of the shape rendered in context. Fill is the inside.
		○ strokeStyle, fillStyle
		○ Can be defined in hex and rgb.
	- Canvas has a coordinate system starting from top left. Similar to Android
  Canvas.
	- Anonymous functions are functions without names
	- Gradient is the increase or decrease in magnitude of a property.
	- Arcs can be used to drop shapes on a curve according to angle.
	- Use the beginPath() and closePath() methods to draw a line or arc.
	- Canvas drawings can be saved with toDataURL method.
	- Images can also be drawn to Canvas.
	- Images can be manipulated through the ImageData object retrieved with
  getImageData from Context.
	- Videos can be modified with Canvas as well with various effects.
	- Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):
		○ Allows you to describe vector graphics using XML
		○ Image preserves quality even when shrunken or enlarged.
		○ Images created with SVG are available via the DOM.
	- Drag and Drop API:
		○ Unsupported by Android and iOS
		○ Used to drag and drop elements from one page to another, or a desktop or
    fileSystem.
		○ Set draggable attribute to any HTML element you want to be draggable.
		○ Add event listener for dragstart (for draggable) dragover (for drop
    events).
		○ Draggable is not boolean, so it must always be set to true.

Questions:
	1. Are there any good cases to use drag and drop attributes for anything
  other than file submission?
  2. Is drag and drop used on images by default? A lot of sites seem to allow me
  to drag and drop images into a new tab.
