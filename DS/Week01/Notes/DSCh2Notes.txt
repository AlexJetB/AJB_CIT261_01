NOTE: All page references are to the page of the PDF, not to the numbered pages
themselves.

P.16
	- WebPages are often written with many parts premade for you (the browser)
  while you will assemble from those premade parts (applets, pages). Such is
  programming. Few start from the ground up.
P.17
	- When you write a page in javascript, you are "creating a bunch of
  operations" for the user.
	- Computer is medium of communication between developer and user.
P.18
	- JavaScript functions have the same structure:
		1. A name
		2. Inputs.
		3. Outputs.
		4. Operations (modifies/verifies inputs to become outputs).
	- A good exercise: Examine "functions" in your daily life as an analogy.
		○ I eat food everyday to produce energy for my daily functions which in turn
    becomes waste.
		○ I read textbooks in order to process knowledge and output work.
		○ I read scriptures to process spiritual knowledge and find purpose/meaning.
P.19-25
	- Exercise for a basic "ugly" JavaScript function is here… Nothing new for me,
  but quick summary:
		○ Use of DOM (AKA, Document Object Model)
		○ innerHTML property (modifies the html within document element).
P.26-27
	- CSS makes the appearance of applications look "nicer".
  - CSS is located within the style tag, or indiv file with <link> tag.
